# super-honeycomb-empire

A Rust reimplementation of [this Python project of mine](https://github.com/dawid-januszkiewicz/HE), which itself is a clone of a 2000s flash game by the title of "Hex Empire"

This project is still a work in progress. Most of the game logic is now implemented and can be compiled to wasm and run in a browser. However, rendering is still missing.
